# Dice Game üé≤

Welcome to the Dice game! This is a simple web-based game that allows two players to roll dice and determine the winner based on the outcome of their rolls.

## How to Play

1. Visit the [Dicee Game](https://amankumarsinhagithub.github.io/Dice-Game/) website.
2. "Refresh" the page to roll the dice and see the results.
3. The player with the higher dice roll wins! If the rolls are the same, it's a draw.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and folders:

- **images**: This folder contains images of dice faces.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the game layout.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that defines the game logic.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the game.

## Game Logic

The JavaScript (`script.js`) file contains functions to generate random numbers, change dice images, and declare winners based on the dice rolls.

The initial dice rolls for Player 1 and Player 2 are displayed upon loading the page, and the winner is declared.
